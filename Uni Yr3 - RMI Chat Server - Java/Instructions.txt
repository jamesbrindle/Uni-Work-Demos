********MAKE SURE PATH AND CLASSPATHS ARE SET**********

A database should already be set up on jbnet.no-ip.org for this to work...



Otherwise, create a mysql database with: 
	

user: brindlej
	
password: helloThere123
	
database name: brindlej

	
	default port no;



Then run the 'brindlej' database script to set up the tables



In a command window navigate to 'bin' folder

Run 'rmiserver.bat'
in a seperate cmd window
Navigate to bin folder
Rrun 'java Chatter'



You should be ready to start chatting via RMI services
